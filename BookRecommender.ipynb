With flaming idealism and stirring slogans, they set out to create a paradise of progress, justice, and equality. Thus the stage is set for one of the most telling satiric fables ever penned \\u2013a razor-edged fairy tale for grown-ups that records the evolution from revolution against tyranny to a totalitarianism just as terrible. When Animal Farm was first published, Stalinist Russia was seen as its target. Today it is devastatingly clear that wherever and whenever freedom is attacked, under whatever banner, the cutting clarity and savage comedy of George Orwell\\u2019s masterpiece have a meaning and message still ferociously fresh.\",\n          \"Since its immediate success in 1813, Pride and Prejudice has remained one of the most popular novels in the English language. Jane Austen called this brilliant work \\\"her own darling child\\\" and its vivacious heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, \\\"as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print.\\\" The romantic clash between the opinionated Elizabeth and her proud beau, Mr. Darcy, is a splendid performance of civilized sparring. And Jane Austen's radiant wit sparkles as her characters dance a delicate quadrille of flirtation and intrigue, making this book the most superb comedy of manners of Regency England.Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780679783268\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Genres\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Magic', 'Childrens', 'Middle Grade', 'Classics']\",\n          \"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Fantasy', 'Politics', 'School', 'Literature']\",\n          \"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Romance', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Historical', 'Audiobook']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}],"source":["df.head(\n",")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"metadata":{"id":"87uApgTH1vma","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1724890498087,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Kirthi Shankar","userId":"08694976959389032862"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["def cosine_similarity(vec1, vec2):\n","  v1 = vec1[0]\n","  v2 = vec2[0]\n","  return np.dot(v1, v2) / (np.linalg.norm(v1) * np.linalg.norm(v2))\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":5,"status":"ok","timestamp":1724890498087,"user":{"displayName":"Kirthi Shankar","userId":"08694976959389032862"},"user_tz":300},"id":"X2IIo8Gk43Ua","outputId":"cd25c099-a35e-4743-bd77-8bd30a47dc0a"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                Book         Author  \\\n","0                              To Kill a Mockingbird     Harper Lee   \n","1  Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone (Harr...

Guillebeau \n","Genres:  ['Business', 'Nonfiction', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Self Help', 'Finance', 'Personal Development', 'Buisness'] \n","Description:  Lead a life of adventure, meaning and purpose— and  earn a good living. “Thoughtful, funny, and compulsively readable, this guide shows how ordinary people can build solid livings, with independence and purpose, on their own terms.”—Gretchen Rubin, author of the #1  New York Times  bestseller  The Happiness Project Still in his early thirties, Chris Guillebeau completed a tour of every country on earth and yet he’s never held a “real job” or earned a regular paycheck. Rather, he has a special genius for turning ideas into income, and he uses what he earns both to support his life of adventure and to give back.  Chris identified 1,500 individuals who have built businesses earning $50,000 or more from a modest investment (in many cases, $100 or less), and focused on the 50 most intriguing case studies. In nearly all cases, people with no special skills discovered aspects of their personal passions that could be monetized, and were able to restructure their lives in ways that gave them greater freedom and fulfillment. Here, finally, distilled into one easy-to-use guide, are the most valuable lessons from those who’ve learned how to turn what they do into a gateway to self-fulfillment. It’s all about finding the intersection between your “expertise”—even if you don’t consider it such—and what other people will pay for.  You don’t need an MBA, a business plan or even employees. All you need is a product or service that springs from what you love to do anyway, people willing to pay, and a way to get paid. Not content to talk in generalities, Chris tells you exactly how many dollars his group of unexpected entrepreneurs required to get their projects up and running; what these individuals did in the first weeks and months to generate significant cash; some of the key mistakes they made along the way, and the crucial insights that made the business stick. Among Chris’s key principles: If you’re good at one thing, you’re probably good at something else; never teach a man to fish— sell  him the fish instead; and in the battle between planning and action, action wins. In ancient times, people who were dissatisfied with their lives dreamed of finding magic lamps, buried treasure, or streets paved with gold. Today, we know that it’s up to us to change our lives. And the best part is, if we change our  own  life, we can help others change  theirs.  This remarkable book will start you on your way.\n","\n","\n","The Art of Success: What No One Ever Taught You (But You Still Need to Know) by:  James Melouney \n","Genres:  ['Self Help', 'Business', 'Personal Development', 'Nonfiction', 'Leadership', 'Productivity', 'Buisness'] \n","Description:  Want to change your life? Then change your mind.In \n","The Art of Success,\n"," James Melouney invites you to see the world differently—by walking in the shoes of 134 extraordinarily successful people. These billionaires and business gurus; sports stars and rock stars; philosophers, emperors, inventors, and saints have lived exceptional lives. So what, exactly, do they know that you don’t?Einstein, Edison, Jobs, and all the others are in these pages for one reason: to reveal the crucial lessons that helped them turn their dreams into reality. And the best part is, anyone can learn them!It doesn’t matter where you come from or what mistakes you’ve made. In fact, humble origins, false starts, and even outright failure can be your biggest assets. What matters is your choice in this moment. Don’t wait.Will you remember today?We are all unique, but as different as we all are, the things we seek in life are astonishingly similar. We all want happiness, fulfillment, health, and financial security. But it seems that only a small group of people are able to achieve what they truly desire in life.So why do some people live exceptional lives, while others seemingly trudge along, never amounting to their true potential and never living the life they know they are capable of?

From iconic entrepreneurs to elite athletes, from artists to billionaire investors, their short profiles can help you answer life's most challenging questions, achieve extraordinary results, and transform your life.From the author:In 2017, several of my close friends died in rapid succession. It was a very hard year, as it was for many people.It was also a stark reminder that time is our scarcest, non-renewable resource.With a renewed sense of urgency, I began asking myself many questions:Were my goals my own, or simply what I thought I should want?How much of life had I missed from underplanning or overplanning?How could I be kinder to myself?How could I better say “no” to the trivial many to better say “yes” to the critical few?How could I best reassess my priorities and my purpose in this world?To find answers, I reached out to the most impressive world-class performers in the world, ranging from wunderkinds in their 20s to icons in their 70s and 80s. No stone was left unturned.This book contains their answers—practical and tactical advice from mentors who have found solutions. Whether you want to 10x your results, get unstuck, or reinvent yourself, someone else has traveled a similar path and taken notes.This book, Tribe of Mentors , includes many of the people I grew up viewing as idols or demi-gods. Less than 10% have been on my podcast ( The Tim Ferriss Show , more than 200 million downloads), making this a brand-new playbook of playbooks.No matter your challenge or opportunity, something in these pages can help.Among other things, you will learn:• More than 50 morning routines—both for the early riser and those who struggle to get out of bed.• How TED curator Chris Anderson realized that the best way to get things done is to let go.• The best purchases of $100 or less (you'll never have to think about the right gift again).• How to overcome failure and bounce back towards success.• Why Humans of New York creator Brandon Stanton believes that the best art will always be the riskiest.• How to meditate and be more mindful (and not just for those that find it easy).• Why tennis champion Maria Sharapova believe that “losing makes you think in ways victories can’t.”• How to truly achieve work-life balance (and why most people tell you it isn’t realistic).• How billionaire Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz transformed the way he engages with difficult situations to reduce suffering.• Ways to thrive (and survive) the overwhelming amount of information you process every day.• How to achieve clarity on your purpose and assess your priorities.• And much more.This reference book, which I wrote for myself, has already changed my life. I certainly hope the same for you.I wish you luck as you forge your own path.All the best,Tim Ferriss\n","\n","\n","Take Command: Find Your Inner Strength, Build Enduring Relationships, and Live the Life You Want (Dale Carnegie Books) by:  Joe   Hart \n","Genres:  ['Personal Development', 'Self Help', 'Nonfiction', 'Business', 'Psychology', 'Productivity', 'Philosophy'] \n","Description:  Take command of your future with this groundbreaking book from the experts who brought you How to Win Friends and Influence People.Take Command offers powerful tools and time-tested methods to help you live an intentional life by transforming how you approach your thoughts, emotions, relationships, and future.
