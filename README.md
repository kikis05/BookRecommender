Current Functionalities: 
- Embeds book descriptions from Kaggle Dataset
- Groups books vectors into hash buckets using locality sensitive hashing (with multiple universes)
- Uses cosine similarity to get closest books descriptions to chosen book
- Book search function with txt.ai

Future:
- Comment code and make more legible
- See if it is possible to iterate through only a few universes and get the same coverage of nearest neighbors
